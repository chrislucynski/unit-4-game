# unit-4-game

<!-- What the project does: -->

This crystal game is designed for the user to try and meet the randomly-generated target score by clicking the different crystals on the page. The values of each crystal are randomly generated each round for added difficulty.  

If the user score is the same as the target score, the user's wins will increase by one. If the user goes over the target score, their losses will increase by one.  

<!-- How users can get started with the project: -->

To get started, the user simply clicks on one of the 4 crystals.  It will display its value on the screen so you know what the value is for that round.  As you click on other crystals, your score will increase based on the value of that new crystal.  

*WARNING* you may have to do math! Figure out how many points are needed to reach the target score and click the crystals the appropriate number of times to get there.
